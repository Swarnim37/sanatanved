                  Jyotish (Indian or also Vedic astrology)
                </h2>
                <p className="leading-relaxed text-left space-y-10">
                  Vedic astrology is sidereal astrology that originated in
                  India, in the Vedic period, a period more than 3000 years ago.
                  It is based on the Vedic philosophy that brought the terms and
                  concepts of karma and reincarnation to the world. Vedic
                  astrology does not only consider the idea of the existence of
                  the soul, its reincarnation, and the accumulation of karma but
                  also perceives the universe as a conscious being of which we
                  are a part. <br /> The Vedic horoscope is a reflection of our
                  life journey in a given incarnation, depicting our nature and
                  destiny (our karma) and pointing out our uniqueness. The
                  purpose of reading is self-knowledge and understanding of our
                  birth. By <q> self-knowledge</q> we mean something more than
                  mere psychological analysis. <br />
                  Based on the horoscope, an astrologer advises us on how to
                  best use the potential we are born with, helps us understand
                  the direction of development and the tendencies that affect us
                  at different stages of our lives, and provides insight into
                  our karma in all areas of life. <br /> The law of karma is
                  seen as a combination of free will and a certain aspect of
                  predestination, therefore a Vedic astrologer also offers
                  within the reading options to manage more difficult karmic
                  tasks and improve our karma.

                  About Jyotish
                </h2>
                <p className="leading-relaxed text-left space-y-4">
                  The culture of ancient India is the only of the ancient
                  cultures that persist to this day, including its many customs,
                  traditional sciences (astrology, Ayurveda, yoga, ...), and
                  philosophy of life in general. <br /> Vedic astrology, called
                  Jyotish in Sanskrit, was first created as one of the
                  supporting texts of the ancient Vedas, the so-called Vedangas.
                  The Vedas are one of the oldest texts that spiritually very
                  advanced sages have acquired during deep meditations. No one
                  knows exactly their true age, they were passed down orally for
                  a long time before they were written around the 15th - 10th
                  century B.C. The Vedas contain knowledge of all areas of life,
                  in particular, the structure of the universe and man &#39;s
                  relationship to <q> divinity</q> . Jyotish, like all Vedic
                  philosophy, is based on three interrelated ideas: 1. man is
                  essentially a spiritual being, 2. the existence of a soul, 3.
                  the law of karma and reincarnation.
                  <br />
                  The task of Jyotir Vedanga, one of the six Vedangas, was to
                  observe the movement of cosmic bodies to determine the
                  appropriate moment for various rituals. The ancient Vedic
                  philosophers knew that we were part of the conscious universe,
                  and everything had to be in harmony with it.
                  <br />
                  Later, astrology became a science of destiny used to
                  understand events on Earth and clarify the life path of the
                  individual. Vedic astrology deals with our soul, which is
                  actually a separate, individualized, part of the cosmic entity
                  (the whole universe is one great organism). The driving force
                  of reincarnation is the desires of our soul. During each
                  incarnation, we accumulate karma (the results of our past
                  actions, thoughts, and intentions) and part of it colors our
                  current incarnation. So, karma is actually something like our
                  programming from the past - our behavior and approach to life.
                  We behave according to past patterns, so there is a kind of
                  inertia. Our destiny is not predetermined, we have free will,
                  and it is up to us how we choose to react in certain
                  situations, whether we change, or whether we continue with our
                  usual pattern. Our activity in this life at the same time, we
                  create our future karma.
                  <br />
                  Vedic astrology shows the cosmic origin and background of
                  forces operating in all areas of human activity. Time is a
                  force field determined by the gravity of the bodies that are
                  in it. In our solar system, the most important factors are the
                  Sun and the planets. The planets are places of light in a vast
                  energy network that gently connects the solar system into a
                  single organism.
                  <br />
                  Each of the planets receives and radiates energy and maintains
                  the balance of the whole system. They constantly radiate
                  different energy patterns and create the network of life.
                  <br />
                  The movement of the planets determines the nature of the
                  different periods of our lives. As the rulers of the time, the
                  planets rule our karma and destiny. Interestingly, Vedic
                  scholars perceived the planets as divine beings or entities
                  that control us in some way, and thus deliver karma to us.
                  (They are agents of higher cosmic intelligence that control
                  the operation of the entire cosmos.)

                  Differences between Vedic and Western Astrology
                </h2>
                <p className="leading-relaxed text-left">
                  Western astrology, i.e., what one commonly encounters in
                  newspapers, magazines, or even in astrological courses or on
                  the Internet, has a lot in common with the Vedic but is even
                  more different. Both branches of astrology use planets, signs,
                  and houses and that&#39;s probably all they have in common. I
                  present the main differences below.
                  <br />
                  <b> a)</b> Vedic astrology uses the sidereal zodiac instead of
                  the tropical zodiac used by western astrology. What is the
                  difference between the two zodiacs? As the name suggests, the
                  sidereal zodiac derives from the actual position of the stars
                  in the sky. If we say that a planet is in the sign of Aries,
                  we will actually see it in the sky against the background of
                  that sign. The tropical zodiac, in contrast to the sidereal,
                  is in fact a mathematical abstraction. According to the
                  tropical zodiac, the Aries sign begins where the vernal
                  equinox point falls that year, regardless of whether or not we
                  see the planet in the background of the Aries sign when viewed
                  from Earth. Likewise, after 30 degrees of Aries, another 30
                  degrees of Taurus will follow, etc. In practice, this means
                  that the sidereal zodiac is shifted back approximately 24
                  degrees from the commonly used tropical zodiac. So when
                  someone was born, for example, on July 10, they think that
                  their Sun is in the sign of Cancer. However, according to the
                  Sidereal zodiac, his Sun is in the sign of Gemini. If we think
                  about the meaning of the word astrology &#40;Astros comes from
                  Greek and means <q> related to the stars </q> , the sidereal
                  zodiac makes more sense than the imaginary mathematically
                  derived zodiac based only on the relative position of the
                  Earth and the Sun (tropical zodiac).
                  <br />
                  <b> b)</b> Vedic astrology, unlike Western astrology, which
                  prefers the Sun, puts more emphasis on the ascendant and the
                  Moon. If someone asks you,<q> What sign are you? </q> They
                  mean the sign of the Moon at the time of your birth. The Moon
                  is important because it reflects our minds and emotions. In
                  addition to affecting our minds, the Moon also determines the
                  sequence of our planetary periods in the most widely used
                  system, the Vimshottari Dasha, because its position in a
                  particular nakshatra determines the initial planetary period.
                  Also, a planetary period sequence can begin in any part of the
                  planetary period: at the beginning, in the middle, or at the
                  end. The ascendant and the location of his ruler define our
                  physical body and our manifestation in the material world, our
                  direction to fulfillment. <br />
                  <b> c) </b> Vedic astrology uses exclusively 7 by the naked
                  eye visible planets and two lunar nodes, a total of 9
                  so-called <q> Navagraha </q> (= 9 planets). Traditional
                  Western astrology also mostly uses 7 traditional planets to
                  determine the house rulership, however, it also works with
                  trans-Saturnians Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Jyotish assumes
                  that planets invisible to the naked eye have no effect on us.
                  Vedic astrology does not work with these planets, although
                  some neo-Vedic astrologers work with them, especially in
                  mundane astrology. Likewise, Vedic astrology does not use
                  asteroids.
                  <br />
                  <b> d)</b> <b>Dashas</b> - planetary period. Vedic astrology,
                  known for its very good ability to predict events, uses many
                  sophisticated systems of planetary periods. Astrologers
                  commonly use several such systems to detect concurrence, a
                  high probability that an event will occur. Western astrology
                  has no similar system, the closest to the Vedic Dasha are
                  firdaria that have the same sequence of planetary periods (of
                  course, each person has planets located differently) for
                  everybody. There are only two different planetary sequences
                  based on day and night birth. The most used system in Jyotish
                  is Vimshottari Dasha, where the starting planetary period
                  depends on the natal position of the Moon and thus is unique
                  for every person. Some people may be born in the middle of the
                  Dasha of Venus, some at the beginning of the Dasha of Jupiter,
                  and some at the end of the planetary period of Rahu (northern
                  node). The Dasha gives us a specific focus in the period
                  depending on the position of the ruling planet in the houses,
                  housesit rules, aspects, and position in the divisional
                  horoscopes. Gochara (transits) are secondary, i.e. if we do
                  not run the planetary period of the planet, its transit will
                  not have a significant impact on our life.
                  <br />
                  <b> e) </b> <b> Vargas </b>or divisional charts- In Western
                  astrology, minimally used divisional (called harmonic) charts
                  are an integral part of the astrological analysis of a Vedic
                  astrologer. Divisional charts are a kind of deeper look into
                  every house of the horoscope, into our past lives, they
                  indicate the real power of the planets (a planet weakened in
                  D1, ie the main horoscope does not have to be weak and vice
                  versa). 12 varga horoscopes are commonly used. They are marked
                  with the letter D and a number, sometimes with their name in
                  Sanskrit. For example, D1 is the main horoscope, sometimes
                  also called the lagna horoscope or rashi. D9 called navamsh is
                  an integral part of horoscope analysis and examines the
                  quality of the planets, marriage, and the fate of the person.
                  <br />
                  <b> f)</b> <b> Nakshatras </b> or also called lunar mansions,
                  are constellations (27, sometimes referred to as 28) in the
                  background of zodiac signs, providing us complementary and
                  more precise information. Each nakshatra is 13 ° 20´ long, so
                  each sign contains 3 different nakshatras and therefore
                  different parts of the sign still have different properties.
                  In natal horoscopes, nakshatras determine the beginning of the
                  sequence of planetary periods in the vimshottari system. In
                  addition to being used in a dasha system, the nakshatras
                  illustrate planetary qualities and specify personality traits.
                  Nakshatras are of great importance and are an integral part of
                  electional astrology called muhurat.
                  <br />
                  <b> g)</b> <b> Yogas</b> - the word yoga in Sanskrit means
                  <q> union </q>. Yoga is unparalleled in Western astrology.
                  They are different combinations and positions of planets that
                  bring different things, such as fame, poverty, health
                  problems, wisdom, success in life, and wealth. There are
                  several hundred yoga classes. To give you an idea, this is a
                  definition of raj yoga (royal yoga): it is a combination
                  (conjunction, a mutual aspect, the reception of the ruler of
                  an angular (4th, 7th, 10th house) with the ruler of the trinal
                  house (1st, 5th or 9th house). Of course, yoga is stronger if
                  one or both planets are domiciled or exalted - such as the
                  conjunctions of the Moon (ruler of the 1st house) and Jupiter
                  (ruler of the 9th house) in the first house in Cancer. Yoga
                  brings to the person material well-being, and career success
                  during the planetary period of the Moon or Jupiter. If the
                  person does not go through these periods during his lifetime,
                  the potential of this yoga cannot be expected to be fully
                  realized. <br />
                  <b> h) </b> <b> Alternative ascendants </b> - in addition to
                  the main horoscope and the divisional D9, Vedic astrologers
                  analyze many other horoscopes - the alternative ascendants.
                  They rotate the horoscope so that the rising sign will be, for
                  example, the sign where the Moon or the ruler of the planetary
                  period, the Sun, or another sign is calculated according to a
                  certain formula. Alternative ascendants describe a specific
                  area in our life.
